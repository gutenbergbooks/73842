[Illustration: [JOSEPHINE MAUD]]


          _Did you think that Josephine Maud was asleep,
          Lying down there on the floor in a heap?
          Oh, deary me, no! you have made a mistake;
          Josephine Maud was quite wide awake._

          _Then why did she lie there, so long, and so still?
          I can’t bear to tell you, and yet—well, I will;
          Josephine Maud was a sad, bad girl,
          She threw down her doll with a toss and a whirl:_

          _She crushed its pink nose, she tore off its wig,
          She whipped her poor doll with a crabapple sprig;
          But temper don’t last, and when it was past,
          Poor Josephine Maud felt very downcast._

          _“Oh! Josephine Maud!” cried her mother, in sorrow,
          “Now what will you do for a dolly tomorrow?”
          “Dear! dear! I’m so sorry,” said poor Josephine:
          And seldom since then has her temper been seen._




[Illustration: [NAUGHTY TOMMY WARNER]]


                         _Tommy!
                         Tommy!
                       Oh, where is Tommy Warner?
                           Naughty boys
                           Break their toys,—
                       Tommy’s in the corner!_




[Illustration: [PAPA HAS GONE TO SEA]]


                      _Heigh ho! heigh ho!
                    Papa has gone to sea.
                      Heigh ho! Heigh ho!
                    What will he bring to me?
                        Shells and corals and a toy!
                        Won’t I be a happy boy!_




[Illustration: [THE MERRY LITTLE TAR]]


                   _Oh, what glory
                   Is in the story
                 Of the boy who went to sea;
                     For he’d sailor clothes
                     And a sunburnt nose
                 And a laugh that was merry and free!_

                   _He climbed so fast
                   The topsail past,
                 And he laughed so loud in his glee,
                     Till a stormy blast
                     Blew him off the mast,
                 And a shark ate him up for his tea!_




[Illustration: [LILLIE LANSING]]


                        _Lillie!
                        Lillie!
                      Ah, here is Lillie Lansing:
                          Right foot!
                          Left foot!
                      Lilian is dancing._




[Illustration: [BED-TIME]]


                           _Fred!
                           Fred!
                         Oh, where is Fred?
                             Eight o’clock!
                             Nine o’clock!
                         Fred has gone to bed._




[Illustration: [HOOPLE]]


                  _Our hooples are rolling around;
                  They’re rolling all over the ground.
                      Who can tell but some day
                      They’ll roll far away,
                  And never, no never, be found._




[Illustration: [THE RACE]]


                  _Good-day! Good-day!
                  Bring out your sleigh,
                      The snow blows in my face, oh!
                  Good-bye! Good-bye!
                  And away we fly!
                      Now who will win the race, oh?_




[Illustration: [SUNSET]]


                _Girls and boys come out to-day,
                The sun is shining on the hay;
                    Yellow and bright is the rising sun,
                    All is gay, and the day’s begun._




[Illustration: [THE BATH]]


            _On a hot summer day, some little fat sparrows
            Thought ’twould be cooling to fly, swift as arrows,
        Over the wall to a nice shady nook
        And take a fresh bath in the clear flowing brook!
          But they splashed, and they chirped,
            And made such a commotion,
          That they turned the clear brook
            To a miniature ocean;
          And the two little sisters,
          Who had watched them at play,
        Laughed out so gayly, it scared them away._




[Illustration: [MY DICKY BIRD]]


                         _My dicky bird!
                         My dicky bird!
                     Where can he be, poor thing?
                           He is sitting alone
                           On a green mossy stone,
                     Trying his best to sing._




[Illustration: [CROQUET]]


                        _Oh, come let us play
                      A game of croquet,
                      Cried rosy-cheeked May
                        To her sister one day._

                        _They played a great game,
                      And then had another;
                      May won the first,
                        But Jane won the other._




[Illustration: [THE CAT AND THE HAT]]


                        _I tell you that
                        I’ve lost my hat;
                      It’s full of roses red.
                          I do wish that
                          I had my hat
                      To tie upon my head!_

                        _I threw it down,
                        Caught up my gown,
                      And ran to catch my cat;
                          I did not get
                          My little pet,
                      And could not find my hat._

                        _Now one, two, three,
                        And, oh, dear me!
                      Whatever shall I do?
                          I’ve lost my hat
                          And my pet cat,
                      Yes, and my temper too._

                         _Josiah Brown
                         Has come to town,
                       He has a pink bouquet;
                           He brought it straight
                           From Applegate,
                       To give to little May._




[Illustration: [SPRING HAS COME]]


                     _The green grass is growing,
                     And a fresh breeze is blowing,
                 And a red robin’s learning to fly, oh!
                       There’s a bush and a pond,
                       And what is beyond?
                 Nothing but bright blue sky, oh!_




[Illustration: [THE BROTHER]]


                  _Two little boys with flying hair,
                    Where summer winds are blowing.
                  Don’t you wish that you were there?
                    For o’er the waves they’re going._

                      _Ding dong, ding dong,
                      Sang out a bell;
                  And off to church went pretty Nell,
                    Went pretty Nell,
                    Went pretty Nell,
                  And off to church went pretty Nell._

                      _Ding dong, dang dong,
                      Called out a bell;
                  And off to school ran pretty Nell,

                    Ran pretty Nell,

                     Came pretty Nell,
                     Came pretty Nell,

                         In the big tea-pot,

                     A rosy little baby

                 Half hidden in the dripping clothes
                   Hanging up to dry._

                 _Some one’s coming up the road,
                   Will she pass them by?
                 They pull the clothes about them close
                   And peep out of one eye._

                 “_Dat’s dear Miss Nancy Dawson
                   What am it she’s got dar?
                 I t’ink it’s beau’ful oranges,

                 As out between the table-cloths
                   Susannah’s face she spied._

                 _Susannah bashfully came forth.
                   Asked Nancy, “Where is Rose?”
                 Just then a timid giggle
                   Came from behind the clothes._

                   Rosalba into view,
                 And Nancy gave them each some fruit,

                      He played very loud,
                      And he played very fast—
                    Ta rumpa, ta rumpa, bum-bum!_

                      Till he made all the boys
                      Stop their ears at his noise—

                  Dream of bright white snow, my baby,
                    Soft and white and deep!
                  Dream of pretty flowers, baby,
                    Pink or white or blue.
                  Pretty little dreams, my baby,

[Illustration: [FRIGHTENED MINNIE]]


        _Out from the trees in an unlooked-for place
        Runs Dorothy Daw with a frightful false-face,
              That grins and glares,
              And thoroughly scares
        Poor Minnie, who thinks it a terrible sight.
              But, Minnie, don’t you mind it!
              There’s a smiling face behind it—
        Very naughty is Miss Dorothy to give you such a fright._

            Merrily rings the childish laughter,
            Echoing straight from floor to rafter.
              Even baby wond’ring stands,
              Clapping both her tiny hands.
            Bubbles are pretty, and float around,
            But why do they burst when they touch the ground?_

[Illustration: [THE SIX LITTLE CHICKENS]]


                         _There were six
                         Little chicks,
                       And little girls two,
             And a bush of sweet-brier grew near:
                         “The chicks must be fed,”
                         The little girls said.
             “Here, chickies, here, chickies, come here!”_

                     _Then came they at last,
                     The chickens, so fast,
             And ate all the corn they could find;
                     But one little chick
                     Was not nearly so quick
                 As the others who left him behind!_

                  That Tricksy was wont to do:_

                _He’d rush upon a dozing frog
                  That blinked beside a mossy log,
                And wildly glare and bark at it,
                  And nearly put it in a fit._

                _Then calmly Tricksy would walk away,
                  And wag his tail as though to say:
                “Cowardice is not a virtue—
                  Tricksy is not the dog to hurt you!”_

                _One day a dog that played with him

                Poor Tricksy went after, with a bound,—
                  Ah, foolish dog! for he was drowned._
